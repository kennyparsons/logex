# Logex
A bash-based, terminal notes/logging utility

_Captain's Log..._

Logex is a small, simple bash script that brings a line-entry log app to your terminal.



Usage: `./logex.sh -f mynotes.log -u myname`

All logs are immediately pushed and saved to the log file specified. Logex conveniently displays the last 5 log messages. It also includes 2 handy commands:
1. `[[cat`: this command will display the full log in the logex terminal window.
2. `[[exit`: this command will cleanly exit logex.
